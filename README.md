# CookBot

Deployed Site: https://cookbot.xyz/

## Description
For my capstone project at Galvanize, I created CookBot, the ultimate recipe resource and cooking guide. It is a fully decoupled app that can access thousands of recipes from the Spoonacular Recipe API and allows users to save their favorite recipes. Features include multiple search options, such as Advanced Search and "What's in my fridge", where users can search for recipes based on what they have on hand. Additionally, CookBot includes "Cooking Mode", where it will read aloud recipe instructions using the IBM Watson text-to-speech API and recognize audio commands allowing users to easily navigate recipes hands-free while cooking.
